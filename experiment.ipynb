    "## Environmental Drum Machine show case: A Python-based drum machine to play JSON-based drum patterns with every day and environmental sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python Notebook is a workaround of what can be done with the EnvironmentalDrumMachine module. As aforementioned in the Project presentations, the goal is to allow the user to select the drum patterns as well as the drum kit setting. The EnvironmentalDrumMachine has been designed to basically allow the user to achieve that. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module comes with some already created drum patterns and the drum kit generated by ourselves using a Drum Part Classification Model, trained with the Freesound One-Shot Percussive Sounds Dataset. For the classification, we have used Essentia and we have reused pieces of code from the MIR Course of this Trimester. Since Essentia is a dependency that may difficult the reproducibility of this experiment, I am directly including the complete drum kit generated with the model. However, you can see an example walkthrough in the attached `classification.ipynb` notebook, which is designed to run on Google Colab, since Essentia runs well there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let's sum up the classification task. The steps followed were: _i)_ Parse and filter and Freesound One-Shot Percussive Sounds Dataset, _ii)_ Extract low-level features using Essentia's Music Extractor, _iii)_ Train a ML model with this data (to be precise, we use two models and we chose the better classification by own criteria), _iv)_ Take set of environmental sounds from Freesound, apply energy threshold to remove the unvoiced regions of the samples as much as possible, and then extract the features again, _v)_ Classify the sounds considering the same features, _vi)_ Arrange manually the folder structure and set intuitive names to the files. **The kit is ready!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is a bit far from being the interactive and visual platform that was proposed at the beginning of the process. However, this framework, is a very intuitive code-based approach that can be easily used. The use can freely include their own samples with no issues. Also, the user can write their own drum patterns, and these keep stored for further use, if needed. This is quite a simple implementation, but the code is easily extandable, given the user the opportunity to add their own improvements to the framework. This project is far from the considered references such as Google AI's Infinite Drum Machine, but it can be easily reproduced and adapted to the likes of the user, which is the goal we were pursing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given technical issues, I have not been able to add a classification step automatically in the framework. I would have been nice to allow the user to automatically classify their sounds to the different drum parts. However, this could be a really interesting step to achieve, in case the user is keen to experiment with ML techniques applied to music creativity.\n",

    "* This software uses the following dependencies: \n",

    "    * pydub\n",
    "    * json\n",
    "    * pprint\n",
    "    * time\n",
    "* **Disclaimer**: This code is not robust to errors yet. **I will be working on it for the next weeks, in case somebody wants to use it for any reason!**, in other words, it assumes that the samples are well located and named, and that are in .wav format. It also assumes that the drum patterns are written correctly, and that the measure length is assigned correctly."
